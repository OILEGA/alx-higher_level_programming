## Javascript Basics
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses
when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. 
This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.
## Variables
Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
```
let myVariable;
```
JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!
After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
```
myVariable = "Bob";
```
Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:
```
let myVariable = "Bob";
```
